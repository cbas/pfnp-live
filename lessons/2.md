# The Front End

Slides for this session are at <http://www.slideshare.net/wilkom/pfnp-slides>

I covered the following (ran out of time for any JS demos/discussion):

*	Summary from last session
*	HTML Tags & CSS Selectors Review
*	The Box Model, Positioning, FlexBox

First off I attempted to get students to install some Atom plugins (not everyone managed it, but they understood what they were).

I then did a quick show-of-hands for who had done any homework from the first session (e.g. nodeschool javascripting and GA fundamentals). Not many people raised their hand - some protested that the previous session was only two days before...

I asked if they wanted to concentrate on the basics of HTML and CSS and the majority of people wanted this (I was expecting to do this anyway, but wanted to check).

PFNP seems to be cramming a lot of topics into a small amount of time, so there can only be partial coverage of technologies and a greater degree of high-level discussion. At the same time I felt that as everyone had installed Atom and wanted to do some coding it was a good idea to cover front-end basics in some detail.

I spent most of the class explaining html and html5 tags and then the main css selectors (element, id, class) and css properties.

Experimented with styling `<img>` `<p>` and `<div>` tags.

Discussed things like `position`, the box model, `overflow`, `display`.

Spoke about Flexbox, did not have time to do Flexbox exercises to the class, but was able to show them some older page layouts (e.g. using `float`s) and also complex hack layouts (e.g. negative margin for sticky footer). Then I showed them some Flexbox layouts and discussed how these were easier to implement and easier to make responsive.

I also demonstrated how Flexbox solved old problems like vertically centering text.

Just squeezed in the CSS3 embedded font syntax at the end.

Generally positive feeling at the end, pretty much everyone managed to code some html and style it with css and then see in a high-level way how this relates to building a web page.

But did not have time to demonstrate any interactivity, although this is explained in the last section of slides and in the example working files. I encouraged them to read on with the slides before the next session.

Thoughts:

* I need more images in my slides to explain concepts like 'block level display' and 'page flow'
* Some exercises were more fun than others - all exercises should have a degree of fun
